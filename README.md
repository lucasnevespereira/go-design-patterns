# Design Patterns in Go

This repo is about design patterns based on articles by [golangbyexample](https://golangbyexample.com/all-design-patterns-golang/).

Code examples are written in Go (Golang).

There a three types of design patterns:


- [Creational Design Patterns](creational)

    Design patterns used for object creation.

    <i>"Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design." (According to Wikipedia)</i>

    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Factory
    - Object Pool
    - Prototype
    - Singleton

    
- [Behavioural Design Patterns](behavioural):

    Design patterns used for object communication.

    <i>"Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication." (According to Wikipedia)</i>

    - Chain of Responsiblity
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Null Object
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

- [Structural Design Patterns](structural):

    Design Patterns used to simplify large structures.

    <i>"Structural design patterns are those that simplify the design of large object structures by identifying relationships between them. They describe common ways of composing classes and objects so that they become repeatable as solutions." (According to Wikipedia)</i>

    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
